tools for people because of stuff and reasons

im eccentric but im chill heres a installer for those that dont want to like... do things,  WHAT the model_pull does is pull models, check ram, check memory space, check drives, installs dependancies, this is my first git dont expect me to know how to write stuff. 

use the tool make it better - duh... wtf... thats why we all here.  this was ORIGINALLY made for me and my peoples so there may be weird naming conventions - idgaf if you change them. its Just a installer.

IF YOU AINT NEVER USE LOCAL AI MODELS BEFORE HERE ARE SOME HELPFUL NOTES BRUH.


if you aint got 32 gigs, do not run 3 models bro... naw
if you got a consumer rig with under 24 gigs of virtual ram  run 2 models qwen and minstral are iight
