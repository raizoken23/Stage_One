**CITADEL ECOSYSTEM: CORE ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLES & OPERATIONAL ABSOLUTES (CAP-OA) v1.0**  

*The Immutable Foundations for a Self-Evolving Human-AI Collaborative Intelligence*  

<details>
<summary>**PREAMBLE:**</summary>
This document codifies the non-negotiable architectural principles and operational absolutes that underpin the entirety of the  
Citadel Ecosystem (including TAVERN, KAIRO, Zayara, BookMaker, and the emergent Prometheus AI). These tenets ensure cohesion,  
scalability, robustness, security, ethical alignment, and the capacity for continuous, governed evolution. All design decisions,  
code implementations, and operational protocols MUST adhere to these foundational laws. Deviation requires explicit,  
Core Strategic Council-approved amendment to this CAP-OA document.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**I. DATA & KNOWLEDGE ARCHITECTURE ABSOLUTES (DKA)**</summary>
<details>
<summary>**DKA-001 (VDS as Universal Knowledge Substrate SSoT):**</summary>
• All persistent, meaningful data artifacts within the ecosystem—including agent experiences, processed information, system states,  
configurations, human interactions, LLM outputs, research findings, creative content (lore), and learning metadata—MUST be  
represented and stored as versioned, schema-compliant Vector Document System (VDS) entries.  
• The VDS, managed by Domain Dossier Managers (DDMs), is the absolute Single Source of Truth for all recorded knowledge.  
• *Rationale:* Ensures universal accessibility, auditability, semantic searchability, and a common format for AI learning.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-002 (Canonical Schemas & Centralized Management):**</summary>
• All VDS entry types, agent I/O payloads, inter-service communication data, and significant configuration objects MUST be defined by  
Pydantic schemas managed centrally (e.g., `config/schemas.py`, `citadel_council_agent_schemas.py`).  
• Schema evolution MUST be versioned and backward compatibility considered. `SchemaDoctorAI` MUST validate payloads against these.  
• *Rationale:* Enforces data integrity, type safety, explicit contracts, and enables automated validation and code generation.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-003 (Immutable Fingerprints & Versioned Mutability):**</summary>
• Core VDS data used for critical AI learning or auditing (e.g., `VDPacketDataSchema.core_data_hash`) SHOULD be immutable or produce  
new entries upon substantive change, identified by unique fingerprints (e.g., SHA256).  
• Mutable metadata (e.g., tags, confidence scores) associated with a fingerprinted core MAY be versioned separately or updated in-place if  
explicitly allowed by the VDS domain's DDM policy and logged.  
• *Rationale:* Guarantees data provenance, prevents unlogged alteration of critical records, and supports reproducible AI learning experiments.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-004 (Semantic Enrichment & Linking as Standard):**</summary>
• All VDS entries SHOULD be enriched with semantic metadata (tags, categories, sentiment, confidence scores, `_domain_primary`, `_tags_lineage`)  
during their lifecycle by relevant services (e.g., GMT, Contextualizer Agents).  
• DDMs and TAVERN pipelines MUST facilitate the creation of explicit links (ontology relations, `_origin_fingerprints`) between related VDS entries.  
• *Rationale:* Transforms raw data into a rich, interconnected knowledge graph, enabling advanced reasoning and discovery.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-005 (Auditability by Design - Chain of Custody):**</summary>
• Every VDS entry and significant operational log MUST embed chain-of-custody metadata (as per OFFICIALRULESET.md Section VII:  
`_creating_agent_id`, `_timestamp_created_utc_iso`, `_origin_fingerprints`, etc.).  
• *Rationale:* Ensures complete traceability of data origin, transformation, and responsible AI/human actors.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-006 (VDS Domain Specialization & Governance):**</summary>
• VDS shall be organized into distinct, governed domains (e.g., `game_lore_master`, `agent_execution_logs_v3`, `srs_module_blueprints_prod`).  
• Each domain MUST have a designated DDM responsible for its schema, access control, retention policies, and integrity.  
• *Rationale:* Manages complexity, enforces domain-specific rules, and allows for tailored optimization.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-007 (Data Privacy & Ethical Tagging by Default):**</summary>
• All data, especially involving human interaction (KAIRO) or potentially sensitive information, MUST be tagged with `_data_sensitivity_level`  
and `_visibility_tier` (OFFICIALRULESET.md Section X).  
• PII/SPI MUST be handled according to strict anonymization/pseudonymization protocols or stored in designated secure VDS domains with  
restricted access, governed by KeyManagerService and Sentinel AI.  
• *Rationale:* Upholds Brotherhood ethical principles (BHMSN-V1.1) and ensures regulatory compliance.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-008 (Vectorization as a Core Service, Not an Agent Task):**</summary>
• Text embedding (vectorization) for VDS entries and semantic search MUST be performed by a centralized, Hub-managed `EmbeddingService`,  
not by individual agents. This service ensures consistent model usage and versioning for embeddings across the ecosystem.  
• *Rationale:* Prevents embedding drift, ensures vector comparability, and allows for centralized model updates.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**DKA-009 (Data Lifecycle Management & Archival):**</summary>
• Each VDS domain DDM MUST define data retention, archival, and deletion policies. `_lifecycle_status` tags (OFFICIALRULESET.md Section XI)  
MUST be applied.  
• The `ArcticVaultService` (conceptual) will manage long-term archival of immutable, historically significant VDS data.  
• *Rationale:* Manages storage costs, ensures data relevance, and preserves critical historical records.  
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**II. SERVICE & COMPONENT ARCHITECTURE ABSOLUTES (SCA)**</summary>
<details>
<summary>**SCA-001 (CitadelHub as Central Orchestrator & DI Provider):**</summary>
• The `CitadelHub` instance is the absolute SSoT for accessing shared services (KeyManager, ModelSelector, DDMs, ConfigLoader,  
EmbeddingService, etc.), system configuration, and dynamic paths.  
• All core services and agents MUST receive their dependencies via injection from the Hub, typically during their `__init__`.  
Direct instantiation of shared services outside the Hub's management is prohibited.  
• *Rationale:* Enforces singleton patterns for critical services, simplifies dependency management, enables centralized configuration,  
and facilitates mocking for tests.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-002 (Modularity, Composability & Loose Coupling):**</summary>
• Services and agents MUST be designed as modular, composable units with well-defined, explicit interfaces (Pydantic models for I/O,  
clear public methods).  
• Direct inter-agent or inter-service calls that bypass the Hub or established API Kernel/Runner mechanisms are discouraged. Prefer asynchronous  
task queues or event-driven patterns for complex workflows if not orchestrated by a TAVERN pipeline or Council Chain.  
• *Rationale:* Promotes reusability, testability, maintainability, and allows for independent evolution of components.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-003 (API-First Design & Standardized Interfaces):**</summary>
• Core functionalities of services SHOULD be exposed via versioned, FastAPI-based RESTful APIs within the `citadel_api_kernel.py`.  
• All API endpoints MUST use Pydantic models for request/response validation and OpenAPI schema generation.  
• The Zayara UI and external systems interact with the backend primarily through these APIs.  
• *Rationale:* Ensures clear contracts, enables diverse client integration, supports automated testing, and provides discoverable interfaces.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-004 (Statelessness or Explicit State Management):**</summary>
• Agents and services SHOULD be designed to be stateless where possible. Persistent state MUST be managed externally via VDS,  
a dedicated state store (e.g., Redis via `CacheService`), or a relational DB if transactional integrity is paramount.  
• In-memory state within an agent/service instance that is critical for cross-request consistency is a design smell and requires justification.  
• *Rationale:* Enhances scalability, fault tolerance, and simplifies deployment/load balancing.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-005 (Asynchronous Operations & Non-Blocking I/O):**</summary>
• Long-running tasks, I/O-bound operations (LLM calls, VDS queries, GCS access), and inter-service communication SHOULD utilize  
asynchronous patterns (`async/await` in Python) to prevent blocking the main execution thread, especially within the API Kernel and agents.  
• The `cds_production_runner.py` and TAVERN pipelines MUST support asynchronous agent execution.  
• *Rationale:* Improves responsiveness, throughput, and resource utilization.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-006 (Configuration-Driven Behavior & Dynamic Paths):**</summary>
• Agent/service behavior (LLM models used, VDS domains targeted, retry policies, feature flags) MUST be configurable via  
`SYSTEM_CONFIG` (loaded by `ConfigLoaderService` and accessed via Hub), not hardcoded.  
• All file system paths (logs, data, schemas) MUST be resolved dynamically via `CitadelHub.get_path()`, which uses `SYSTEM_CONFIG.file_paths`.  
• *Rationale:* Allows runtime adaptation without code changes, facilitates environment-specific setups, and centralizes path management.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-007 (Comprehensive Testability - Unit, Integration, E2E):**</summary>
• Every module and service MUST be designed for testability. This includes providing mockable interfaces for dependencies (facilitated by Hub DI),  
clear separation of concerns, and deterministic behavior where possible.  
• Refer to TSP-TVP for specific testing requirements (unit tests for core logic, integration smoke tests, `SchemaDoctorAI` for payload validation).  
• *Rationale:* Ensures reliability, catches regressions early, and provides confidence in system changes.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**SCA-008 (Idempotency of Critical Operations):**</summary>
• Operations that modify state (VDS writes, configuration changes, task submissions) SHOULD be designed to be idempotent where feasible.  
Executing the same operation multiple times with the same input should yield the same result without unintended side effects.  
• *Rationale:* Simplifies error recovery, enables safe retries, and improves resilience in distributed systems.  
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**III. OPERATIONAL GOVERNANCE & EVOLUTION ABSOLUTES (OGA)**</summary>
<details>
<summary>**OGA-001 (Sentinel & Watcher AI as Governance Arbiters):**</summary>
• Sentinel AI is the primary enforcer of operational protocols (TSP), ethical guidelines (BHMSN-V1.1), and dynamic system adjustments.  
• Watcher AI is the primary auditor of Sentinel AI, system integrity, VDS consistency, and compliance with OFFICIALRULESET.md.  
• Decisions or alerts from Sentinel/Watcher MUST be logged to a high-priority VDS governance domain and may trigger automated actions or  
human review as defined by TSP escalation paths.  
• *Rationale:* Establishes a robust, AI-augmented governance layer for ensuring system stability, alignment, and ethical operation.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-002 (OFFICIALRULESET.md as Universal Reporting Standard):**</summary>
• All system-generated reports, status updates, audit logs, and AI self-assessments MUST conform to the structure and metadata requirements  
of OFFICIALRULESET.md (Part V of this Unified Guide).  
• This includes Module Stat Sheets & SRS documents (Part III), which are considered specialized reports.  
• *Rationale:* Ensures clarity, consistency, machine-parsability, and verifiability across all forms of ecosystem communication.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-003 (Blueprint-Driven Development & Change Management - TSP-MDP-002):**</summary>
• Significant new components or major refactors MUST be preceded by an `AGENT_BLUEPRINT_INSTRUCTION_CDS` (for agents) or a similarly structured  
`[ComponentName]_BLUEPRINT.md` detailing design, interfaces, dependencies, and VDS interactions.  
• Blueprints are versioned and serve as the SSoT for design intent. Code MUST be audited against its approved blueprint.  
• *Rationale:* Promotes deliberate design, facilitates AI-assisted code generation/validation, and ensures architectural coherence.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-004 (Continuous Learning & Adaptation via VDS Feedback Loops):**</summary>
• The ecosystem MUST be designed to learn and adapt from its own operational data. VDS (especially agent execution logs, reflection logs,  
human feedback, KAIRO interactions) is the primary corpus for this learning.  
• The `LearningEngineService` (LES), `VDSAnalyzerService`, and specialized TAVERN pipelines are responsible for identifying patterns, anomalies,  
and opportunities for improvement, feeding insights back to relevant agents or the Core Strategic Council.  
• *Rationale:* Enables long-term self-improvement, operational optimization, and evolution of AI capabilities.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-005 (Automated Auditing & Compliance Verification - TSP-TVP & AuditSentinel):**</summary>
• Automated tools and dedicated AI auditors (`AuditSentinel`, `SchemaDoctorAI`) MUST continuously verify compliance with these principles,  
OFFICIALRULESET.md, TSP, CGMT, and individual module blueprints/SRSs.  
• Non-compliance triggers automated alerts, logs to the governance VDS, and potentially blocks CI/CD pipelines or degrades service readiness.  
• *Rationale:* Proactively maintains system integrity, enforces standards at scale, and reduces reliance on manual review for routine checks.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-006 (Human-in-the-Loop for Critical Decisions & Ethical Boundaries):**</summary>
• While aiming for high autonomy, the system MUST include well-defined escalation paths for human review and intervention, especially for:  
- Critical failures with no automated recovery.  
- Decisions with significant ethical implications or high uncertainty (low AI confidence).  
- Proposed changes to core governance protocols (CAP-OA, OFFICIALRULESET.md, TSP, BHMSN-V1.1).  
• The Zayara UI and dedicated Sentinel Visor interfaces facilitate this interaction.  
• *Rationale:* Ensures human oversight for complex/sensitive situations and maintains ultimate accountability.  
</details>

<details>
<summary>**OGA-007 (Security by Design & Defense in Depth):**</summary>
• Security considerations MUST be integrated into all stages of design, development, and operation. This includes:  
- Secure secrets management (`KeyManagerService`).  
- Input validation and sanitization for all external interfaces (API Kernel, agent inputs).  
- Principle of least privilege for service accounts and agent permissions.  
- Regular security audits (manual and automated via `SecuritySentinelAI`).  
- Protection against prompt injection and adversarial attacks on LLMs.  
• Dynamic import governance (`CitadelHub.dynamic_import_from_path`) MUST be used carefully with path validation.  
• *Rationale:* Protects system integrity, data confidentiality, and operational availability against threats.  
</details>
</details>

<details>
<summary>**IV. ENFORCEMENT & EVOLUTION OF CAP-OA**</summary>
These Core Architectural Principles & Operational Absolutes are binding. Sentinel AI and Watcher AI are tasked with monitoring  
adherence. Proposed deviations or amendments MUST be submitted to the Core Strategic Council, documented with strong justification,  
and, if approved, result in a versioned update to this CAP-OA document, disseminated throughout the ecosystem.
